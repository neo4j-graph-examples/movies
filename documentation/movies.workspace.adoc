==  What is Cypher?

Cypher is a graph query language that is used to query the Neo4j Database. Just like you use SQL to query a MySQL database, 
you would use Cypher to query the Neo4j Database.

A simple Cypher query can look something like this 


[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie) WHERE m.released > 2000 RETURN m LIMIT 5
----

[TIP]
====
You can click on arrow or the icon:play-circle[] in the query above to populate it in the Cypher Editor in the Query tab.
====


*Expected Result*: The above query will return all the movies that were released after the year 2000 limiting the result to 5 items.


image::{img}/5-movies.svg[width="100%"]

*Try*

. Write a query to retrieve all the movies released after the year 2005.
+
[source.try-cypher-result,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie) WHERE m.released > 2005 RETURN m

----

. Write a query to return the count of movies released after the year 2005. (Hint: you can use the `COUNT(m)` function to return the count)

+
[source.try-cypher-result,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie) WHERE m.released > 2005 RETURN COUNT(m)
----

== Nodes and relationships

Nodes and relationships are the basic building blocks of a graph database.

*Nodes*

Nodes represent entities. 
A node in graph database is similar to a row in a relational database. 
In the picture below we can see 2 kinds of nodes - `Person` and `Movie`. 
When writing a Cypher query, a node is enclosed in parenthesis — like `(p:Person)` where `p` is a variable and `Person` is the type of node it is referring to.

image::{img}/schema.svg[width="100%"]

*Relationship*

Two nodes can be connected with a relationship. 
In the above image `ACTED_IN`, `REVIEWED`, `PRODUCED`, `WROTE` and `DIRECTED` are all relationships connecting the corresponding types of nodes.

When writing a Cypher query, relationships are enclosed in square brackets - like `[w:WORKS_FOR]` where `w` is a variable and `WORKS_FOR` is the type of relationship it is referring to.

Two nodes can be connected with more than one relationships, as you can see in the image above.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[d:DIRECTED]-(m:Movie) WHERE m.released > 2010 RETURN p,d,m
----

[TIP]
====
You can click on arrow or the icon:play-circle[] in the query above to populate it in the Cypher Editor in the Query tab.
====

*Expected Result*: The above query will return all Person nodes who directed a movie that was released after 2010.

image::{images}/movies-after-2010.svg[width="100%"]

*Try*

1. Query to get all the people who acted in a movie that was released after 2010.
+
[source.try-cypher-result,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[d:ACTED_IN]-(m:Movie) WHERE m.released > 2010 RETURN p,d,m
----

== Labels

A label is a name or identifier of a node or a relationship. 
In the image below `Movie` and `Person` are node labels and `ACTED_IN`, `REVIEWED`, etc are relationship types.

image::{img}/schema.svg[width="100%"]

When writing a Cypher query, labels are prefixed with a colon - like `:Person` or `:ACTED_IN`. 
You can assign the node label to a variable by prefixing the syntax with the variable name, such as `(p:Person)` means `p` variable denoted `Person` labeled nodes.


Labels are used when you want to perform operations only on a specific types of nodes, like: 

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p LIMIT 20
----

will return only `Person` nodes (limiting to 20 items) while 

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n) RETURN n LIMIT 20
----

will return all kinds of nodes (limiting to 20 items).


== Properties

Properties are name-value pairs that are used to add attributes to nodes and relationships.

To return specific properties of a node you can write:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie) RETURN m.title, m.released
----

image::{img}/movies-properties.jpg[width="100%"]

*Expected Result* - This will return Movie nodes but with only the `title` and `released` properties.

*Try*

. Write a query to get `name` and `born` properties of the Person node.

+
[source.try-cypher-result,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p.name, p.born
----

== Create a node

A `CREATE` clause can be used to create a new node or a relationship. 


[source, cypher]
CREATE (p:Person {name: 'John Doe'}) RETURN p

The above statement will create a new `Person` node with property `name` having value `John Doe`.

*Try*

1. Create a new `Person` node with a property `name` having the value of your name.
+
[source.try-cypher-result,cypher]
----
CREATE (p:Person {name: '<Your Name>'}) RETURN p
----

== Finding nodes with MATCH and WHERE clauses

A `MATCH` clause is used to find nodes that match a particular pattern. 
This is the primary way of getting data from a Neo4j database. 

In most cases, a `MATCH` is used along with certain conditions to narrow down the result.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Tom Hanks'}) RETURN p
----

This is one way of doing it, although it only allows you to do basic string match based filtering (without using `WHERE` clause).

Another way would be to use a `WHERE` clause which allows for more complex filtering including `>`, `<`, `STARTS WITH`, `ENDS WITH`, etc.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.name = "Tom Hanks" RETURN p
----

Both of the above queries will return the same results.

You can read more about `WHERE` clause and list of all filters here - https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/where/

*Try*

. Find the movie with title "Cloud Atlas"
+
[source.try-cypher-result,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie {title: "Cloud Atlas"}) RETURN m
----

. Get all the movies that were released between 2010 and 2015.
+
[source.try-cypher-result,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie) WHERE m.released > 2010 AND m.released < 2015 RETURN m
----

== The MERGE clause

The `MERGE` clause is used to either

. match the existing nodes and bind them or
. create new node(s) and bind them

It is a combination of `MATCH` and `CREATE` and additionally allows to specify additional actions if the data was matched or created.


[source, cypher]
----
MERGE (p:Person {name: 'John Doe'})
ON CREATE SET p.createdAt = timestamp()
ON MATCH SET p.lastLoggedInAt = timestamp()
RETURN p
----

The above statement will create the Person node if it does not exist. 
If the node already exists, then it will set the property `lastLoggedInAt` to the current timestamp.
If the node does not exist and is created instead, then it will set the `createdAt` property to the current timestamp.


*Try*

. Write a query using `MERGE` to create a movie node with title "Greyhound". 
If the node does not exist, then set its `released` property to 2020 and `lastUpdatedAt` property to the current time stamp. 
If the node already exists, then only set `lastUpdatedAt` to the current time stamp. 
Return the movie node.
+
[source.try-cypher-result,cypher]
----
MERGE (m:Movie {title: 'Greyhound'})
ON CREATE SET m.released = "2020", m.lastUpdatedAt = timestamp()
ON MATCH SET m.lastUpdatedAt = timestamp()
RETURN m
----

== Create a relationship

A relationship connects two nodes.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person), (m:Movie)
WHERE p.name = "Tom Hanks" AND m.title = "Cloud Atlas"

CREATE (p)-[w:WATCHED]->(m)
RETURN type(w)
----

The above statement will create a relationship `:WATCHED` between the existing `Person` and `Movie` nodes and return the type of relationship (i.e `WATCHED`).

*Try*

. Create a relationship `:WATCHED` between the node you created for yourself previously in step 6 and the movie "Cloud Atlas" and then return the type of created relationship
+
[source.try-cypher-result,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person), (m:Movie)
WHERE p.name = "<Your Name>" AND m.title = "Cloud Atlas"

CREATE (p)-[w:WATCHED]->(m)
RETURN type(w)
----

== Relationship types

In Neo4j, there can be two kinds of relationships - **incoming** and **outgoing**.

image::{img}/relationship-types.svg[width='400']

In the above picture, the "Tom Hanks" node is said to have an outgoing relationship while the "Cloud Atlas" node is said to have an incoming relationship.

Relationships always have a direction. 
However, you only have to pay attention to the direction where it is useful.

To denote an outgoing or an incoming relationship in cypher, we use `->` or `<-`.

Example -

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie) RETURN p,r,m
----

In the above query, `Person` has an outgoing relationship and `Movie` has an incoming relationship.

Although, in the case of the movies dataset, the direction of the relationship is not that important and even without denoting the direction in the query, it will return the same result. So the query

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]-(m:Movie) RETURN p,r,m
----

will return the same reuslt as the above one.

*Try*

. Write a query to find the nodes `Person` and `Movie` which are connected by a `REVIEWED` relationship and is outgoing from the `Person` node and incoming to the `Movie` node.
+
[source.try-cypher-result,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:REVIEWED]-(m:Movie) RETURN p,r,m
----

== Advanced Cypher queries

Let's look at some questions that you can answer with Cypher queries.

. *Finding who directed the "Cloud Atlas" movie*
+
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'Cloud Atlas'})<-[d:DIRECTED]-(p:Person) RETURN p.name
----

. *Finding all people who have co-acted with Tom Hanks in any movie*
+
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (tom:Person {name: "Tom Hanks"})-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(p:Person) RETURN p.name
----

. *Finding all people related to the movie "Cloud Atlas" in any way*
+
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[relatedTo]-(m:Movie {title: "Cloud Atlas"}) RETURN p.name, type(relatedTo)
----
+
In the above query, we only used the variable `relatedTo` which will try to find all the relationships between any `Person` node and the movie node "Cloud Atlas"

. Finding `Movies` and `Actors` that are 3 hops away from Kevin Bacon.
+
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Kevin Bacon'})-[*1..3]-(hollywood) RETURN DISTINCT p, hollywood
----

[NOTE]
====
In the above query, `hollywood` refers to any node in the database (in this case `Person` and `Movie` nodes).
